        <h1> <u>Is My Country Happy?</u> </h1>
        <img src='imgs\project.gif'>
        <h2> <u>Overview</u> </h2>
        <p> While browsing Kaggle to look for datasets, I stumbled upon this dataset:</p>
        <img id='kagglebanner' src='imgs\kagglebanner.png'>
        <p> The dataset revolves around a country and its happiness score and I was intrigued by how exactly
            <br>
            this happiness score is calculated. Happiness is a very subjective topic and what makes a
            <br>
            person happy varies from person to person, so I took a look at the dataset to see what
            it contained.
            <br>
            Before I go into investigating the data, I hypothesized that Healthy life expectancy is definitely going to be a big
            <br>
            factor in a country's happiness because if the average population of a country lives for a very long time,
            <br>
            naturally we can assume that they have been provided the resources to live long and happy. In order to verify
            <br>
            this conclusion I will have to determine what variables are strongly correlated. We're going to use data from kaggle
            <br>
            and use pandas for processing the data, sklearn to build a model and make predictions, and matplotlib.pyplot for plots
            <br>
            and visualizations.
        </p>
        <h2> <u>Data</u> </h2>
        <p>
            The data collected was surveyed from people within the country and then when asked the specific attributes from the 
            <br>
            csv, people were told to rate that specific attribute on a scale of 0 to 10 where 10 is the best.
            <br>
            So after the dataset caught my eyes, I set up my environment and loaded the dataset of the world happiness
            <br>
            score from 2019 into pandas (link <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/unsdsn/world-happiness?select=2019.csv'>here</a>)
            then I set the pandas settings to show all rows and cols and printed the dataframe, which gave me this:
            <br>
            <img src='imgs\df.png'>
            <br>
            This doesn't really tell us much about how these variables are related or if they even are related,
            <br>
            so let us put some data science skills to work.
        </p>
        <h2> <u> Mean </u> </h2>
        <p>
            Before we jump into figuring out how closely related variables are, lets take a look at the mean
            <br>
            of the dataset to get a taste out what our data is like. Running a quick df.mean() and looking
            <br>
            at the relevant fields we get:
            <br>
            <img src='imgs\mean.png'>
            <br>
            Looks like on average, these are the numbers expected of an average country.
        </p>
        <h2> <u> Correlation </u></h2>
        <p>
            The first thing I want to know is how closely related our variables are. I went on to find the correlation
            <br>
            coefficient of all the variables with respect to the country's happiness score. The correlation coefficients came out to be like this:
            <br>
            <img src='imgs\correlation.png'>
            <br>
            Score in this case is the happiness score, and here we can see that there are three variables/factors that are strongly
            <br>
            related to a country's happiness score. The factors that contribute most to a country's happiness score is: GDP per capita, social support, and healthy life expectancy.
            <br>
            Now that we know which variables are strongly related, we can use some visualizations to further investigate the trend of the data.
        </p>
        <h2> <u>Visualizations</u> </h2>
        <p>
            Here we want to do some plotting and see how our data looks like visually. Here are the three plots:
            <br>
            <div id='plot-div'>
                <img src='plots\happiness_score_vs_gdp.png'>
                <img src='plots\happiness_score_vs_healthy_life_expectancy.png'>
                <img src='plots\happiness_score_vs_social_support.png'>
            </div>
            <br>
            The plots above confirm that we do have a relatively strong positive correlation between the x and y variables.
            <br>
            From this we can conclude that GDP per capita, healthy life expectancy, and social support are all strongly positively associated
            <br>
            with each other. We also have some outliers that might affect our model's accuracy, but we can get rid of a few that are super far away
            <br>
            from the cluster of points to improve our model's accuracy. I chose to get rid of Somalia and Central African Republic as they had a GDP
            <br>
            of zero and GDP is the strongest factor in determining a country's happiness score.  
        </p>
        <h2> <u> Making Predictions (Using techniques) </u> </h2>
        <p>
            Now that we have all the observations and data we need to build a relatively accurate model, I went on ahead and created a linear regression
            <br>
            model and used sklearns train_test_split to split our dataset into a training set and a testing set. After doing some research, I opted to use 
            <br>
            a 80:20 train to test ratio. Using the x_test from train_test_split now we can see our predictions using our classifier's predict() function from sklearn's linear regression model:
            <br>
            <img src='imgs\predictions.png'>
            <br>
            This doesn't tell us much, so let us look at our model's accuracy instead by calling on our classifier's .score() function
            <br>
            <img src='imgs\model_accuracy.png'>
            <br>
            We have a model accuracy of about 75%, which is pretty good.
